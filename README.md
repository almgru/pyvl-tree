# pyvl-tree

_pyvl-tree_ is an a self-balancing binary search tree (BST) implemented using the Adelson-Velsky & Landis, _AVL_, algorithms.

A self-balancing BST has the valuable property that its height is at most _log<sub>2</sub>(n)_, 
where _n_ is the number of elements in the tree. This means that __search__, __insertion__ and __deletion__ 
has more reliable performance than an ordinary BST as the number of elements in the tree increases.

## Install
Install with,

```
pip install pyvl-tree
```

## API

### `class pyvltree.AVLTree`
A recursive implementation of a self-balancing binary search tree. Self-balancing is achieved using the AVL algorithms.

#### `AVLTree()`
Constructor. Creates a AVLTree object and returns it.

#### `search(key)`
Search for an element given an equivalent key.

Equivalence is determined based on the elements __eq__ method.

Time complexity: O(log n)

Returns the element equivalent to the key if found, None otherwise.

#### `size()`
Returns the number of elements in the tree.

Time complexity: O(1)

#### `insert(obj)`
Insert an element into the tree.

Duplicate elements will be silently discarded.

Time complexity: O(log n)

#### `delete(obj)`
Deletes an element from the tree.

Time complexity: O(log n)
